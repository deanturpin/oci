Greetings from the High Commission of India, London.
The OCI needs to be updated with the married name before travelling.
 
The OCI process has been outsourced to VFS (UK) and the application will have to be deposited with one of its centres.

Please note that the re-issuance of OCI is mandatory every time passport is renewed up to the age of 20 years, and again after attaining the age of 50 years in view of frequent biological change in facial features in these age group. Please view the full requirements for OCI Re-issue for more information at the following link: Click Here.

<blockquote>
In March 2016, the Government of India announced that OCI card holders will no longer need a visa to enter India. The ‘U’ visa sticker that was placed in the foreign passport of OCI card holders has been discontinued with immediate effect and you’ll no longer need to show this sticker to the immigration authorities when you enter and leave India. You’ll only need to present a valid passport and your OCI card. For more information, visit the website of the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs.

In case of change of address/occupation, simply log into OCI miscellaneous services website, make the required address or occupation change and you are done. There is also no fee for this type of change. When you initiate a change of address or occupation via miscellaneous services, new OCI documents are not issued.

Carry both passports, OCI book and your marriage certificate.

Alternatively, you can get the name changed in the OCI.

<blockquote>
OCI registration certificate and visa have got to be re-issued by availing this service, each time a new passport is issued up to the completion of 20 years of age and once after completing 50 years of age in view of biological changes in face of the applicant.
 
Re-issuance of OCI registration certificate and visa is not mandatory, each time a new passport is issued between 21-50 years of age. However, if the applicant wishes to avail this service, he/she can apply for the same.

<blockquote>
Foreigners holding OCI cards are required to carry their foreign passport bearing 'U' visa sticker for travel to India. However, due to expiry or re-issue of their foreign passports, these foreigners are issued new passports, as such they are allowed to travel to India with their new passport along with old passports/cancelled passports having 'U' visa sticker.
</blockquote>
http://www.cgisf.org/notice/display/135
 
<blockquote>
Passengers who are carrying old cancelled passports having Life Long Indian "U" Visa Sticker affixed on it along with new passport are allowed entry into India.
Even if the OCI card holder acquires nationality of a different country, except that of Pakistan and Bangladesh, he/she is also allowed entry into India provided he/she is carrying his/her old passport having Life Long Indian "U" Visa sticker pasted on it along with the new passport of the recently acquired nationality.
